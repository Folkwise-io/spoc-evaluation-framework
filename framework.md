# The SPOC archetype framework for evaluating software developers (and other IT professionals)

## Introduction

Not a lot of companies know how to evaluate developers and other technical personnel. There are several superstitions and misconceptions, which make matters worse. We won't go into the details, but here are a few such myths:

* Developers who type fast get more work done.
* Hiring more developers gets the project done faster.
* Developers are a commodity resource.
* Education matters a lot.
* Experience matters a lot.
* All developers are expensive.
* Expensive developers are good developers.
* Consultants are a bad idea.
* PHP/Perl/Python/JavaScript/Java/etc. developers are bad developers.
* Developers who can do functional programming are great developers.
* ...and the list goes on. 

In order to clear up the confusion, we're presenting here, in plain english, **the SPOC framework**, a system that works and is tried-and-tested. We use this system at [Mintbean](https://mintbean.io) to hire personnel for our clients and for ourselves. 

The SPOC framework was created by [Monarch Wadia](https://linkedin.com/in/monarchwadia) and draws on his professional experience as a software architect and business leader.

# The traits

## S - Schooling

This trait measures formal education in computer science & software engineering. 

Any formal instruction counts toward this trait, including high school software development classes, diploma courses, professional certification, development bootcamps, coursework completed, and completed university degrees.

## P - Practice

Practice is the time and effort spent building projects using code, whether in the workplace, at school, or as a hobbyist.


## O - Organizational

This is a measure of experience the candidate has in a technical workplace environment. 

This is not necessarily workplace experience as a developer. This could be a non-technical person, such as a manual QA specialist or a business analyst, working closely with an engineering team.

## C - Community

This indicates familiarity with and participation in the developer community.

Here they are in detail:

## Adventurer :boat:

Adventurers are brand new entrants in the tech world. Often, they're explorers, and are curious about the tech world and the opportunities that lay therein. They have no exposure to the software industry at all. Many of them are looking for their first opportunities in technology, and some might be applying for a job that is similar to ones they've had in the past.

Adventurers are wildcards. You never know what you're going to get with them -- which is simultaneously their biggest strength and their biggest weakness. They can bring unique strengths and synergies. Expect the unexpected with these brave souls.

------

## Spectator :newspaper:

Spectators are deeply interested in the world of tech, but have never worked in it. This person could be an Adventurer who has been curious about the technical world for a while, but has never worked in it.

Spectators have spent significant amounts of time reading about and interacting with the world of software development. They can work in fields that interact with the engineering community in some way or another.

##  Nontechnical :briefcase:

The Nontechnical has worked in a technical company, or closely with a technical department, but not in a technical capacity. These people are familiar with the rhythm and flow of a technical department. They are often liaisons between engineering departments and business departments, and bring a lot of specialized experience with them.

------

##  Facilitator :smiley:

Facilitators are people who are very familiar with the developer community, but are not developers themselves, nor do they have technical schooling. They understand software development and the engineering mindset and typically work well with developers.

Facilitators fit well into organizations and departments that work closely with the engineering community. The best role for facilitators is one centered around understanding, supporting and nurturing the other archetypes. Facilitators deeply understand both business folk and developers, and can act as translators between these two departments.

##  Tinkerer :wrench:

Tinkerers are pure technicians. They've focused on making machines do their bidding. They take pride in their technical skill and may be hobbyist programmers in their off-hours. 

Tinkerers often can work wonders with Excel macros, and often write small scripts that make their coworkers' jobs a bit easier. However, they haven't (yet) invested the time in learning best practices or getting to know the culture and community surrounding the language they know best.

------

##  Hacker :neckbeard:

Hackers are Tinkerers who have invested more time in understanding the culture surrounding the language of their choice. These are self-taught developers who truly enjoy software development, and may be self-studying their way into a software development role.

Hackers are beyond seeing code as just a tool. They're enthusiasts, and understand the aesthetic beauty of software development. They could be idealists at heart, and might subscribe to open-source philosophy. Given mentorship and experience in a mature software development team, these people have the potential to become some of the best software developers you've ever seen.

------

## Savvy :bulb:

Savvies bring experience in writing scripts and programs to the departments they work in. Very often, savvies work in quantitative professions such as accounting or finance, and have picked up coding as yet another tool in their number-crunching toolbelt.

Savvies have the business knowledge to build software that solves real problems, but have gaps in theoretical and practical knowledge that ultimately put them squarely in the realm of business and NOT technology.

##  Self-Taught :squirrel:

These gritty individuals have dedicated their professional lives to code. They've successfully broken into the software development profession, and rightfully see themselves as full-fledged software developers. They may have previous experience as non-technical professionals, which they've left behind, but that experience is valuable and still informs their work on a near-daily basis.

The Self-Taught archetype is one of the best fits for a software development role. What they don't know theoretically, they make up for with passion for their work, dedication to their craft, and a knowledge of their tools and their community.

##  Academic :book:

Academics are those who have studied computer science without any significant coding experience or experience working in the industry. These individuals may have significant prior work experience outside software development. Many recent graduates fit this archetype, as do individuals who got their degree or diploma in software engineering or computer science but then moved into a non-technical profession.

Academics understand computer science and software engineering to a certain degree, but may not fully understand the psychology of a software developer or the inner workings of a well-run software engineering department. They are good fits for roles that fit their prior work experience or junior-level non-technical roles.

##  Researcher :telescope:

Similar to the Academic, the Researcher has spent significant amounts of time studying the software development industry. In addition to book knowledge, the Researcher understands the state of the industry from an outsider's perspective. They are frequently able to come up with deep insights about the industry.

Researchers are often computer science or engineering students who are passionate about technology, but not necessarily about coding. Such students can make excellent additions to non-technical departments, and often show curiosity and passion about the industry and its players.

##  Organizer :bookmark_tabs:

Organizers are people who help software departments and companies run efficiently and smoothly. Without any special inclination towards coding, these tend to be industry specialists who have studied software development and made it their home.

Very often, the academic background of an Organizer is irrelevant. They have understood the mechanics of information technology to a certain degree, but do not show any inclination towards learning to code or to learning more about development culture.

##  Natives :pencil:

Natives are at home in the world of software development. They have studied a technical field, possess relevant industry experience, and have researched the industry to a point where they understand trends in technology and understand long-term trends that may affect the business.

Natives are non-technical, but are well-suited to leadership positions in software development firms. Since they have the conceptual background to do so, they might be able to lead a software development team in a limited capacity. Many of them do so on a regular basis, to varying degrees of success.

##  Fledgling :seedling:

Fledglings have studied software development and have built several projects of varying sizes, maybe as part of their coursework. Many software development bootcamp graduates fall into this category. They may be building their portfolio of projects and working towards their first software development jobs.

Many fledglings eventually land their first software development job, although most take on non-technical or semi-technical roles. Some move out of the software development industry altogether, following their passion or their curiosity to greener pastures.

##  Seeker :eyeglasses:

Seekers are serious software development students who have dedicated large amounts of their personal and professional time to learning as much as possible about software development. They are actively looking for their first software development jobs.Many seekers may accept non-technical roles, but nothing would make them happier than landing a software development role.

Seekers sometimes come from other industries, especially via bootcamps and short diploma programs. They might have something to prove, and as such can make very dedicated and enthusiastic employees.

##  Careerist :office:

The vast majority of software developers are Careerists. They understand the various tools of their specific industry or language, and might even know many popular libraries in their ecosystem, but they have not put in the effort to learn the culture and community surrounding those tools (although they might look up tutorials and examples on a near-daily basis).

Careerists make excellent intermediate developers, QA Engineering professionals and long-term hires. They are professional software developers, but tend not to be overly passionate about the craft of development.

##  Star :star:

Stars are enthusiastic software developers who eat, drink, sleep and dream software development. These are career developers who have studied software development professionally, have experience as developers in the software development industry, and often actively partake in the dev community they are a part of.

Some of the best software developers are Stars. They make excellent technical leaders and are an inspiration to younger developers who have the privilege of working with them. They fit well into technical organizations and are capable of building projects from scratch with strong technical foundations. However, they might not fit well into organizations that are primarily non-technical or that do not have a strong software development culture.
