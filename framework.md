# The SPOC framework of developer competency

## Introduction

Not a lot of companies know how to evaluate developers and other technical personnel. There are several superstitions and misconceptions, which make matters worse. We won't go into the details, but here are a few such myths:

* Developers who type fast get more work done.
* Hiring more developers gets the project done faster.
* Developers are a commodity resource.
* Education matters a lot.
* Experience matters a lot.
* All developers are expensive.
* Expensive developers are good developers.
* Consultants are a bad idea.
* PHP/Perl/Python/JavaScript/Java/etc. developers are bad developers.
* Developers who can do functional programming are great developers.
* ...and the list goes on. 

In order to clear up the confusion, we're presenting here, in plain english, **the SPOC framework**, a system that works and is tried-and-tested. We use this system at [Mintbean](https://mintbean.io) to hire personnel for our clients and for ourselves. 

The SPOC framework was created by [Monarch Wadia](https://linkedin.com/in/monarchwadia) and draws on his professional experience as a software architect and business leader.

# The traits

## S - Schooling

This trait measures formal education in computer science & software engineering. 

Any formal instruction counts toward this trait, including high school software development classes, diploma courses, professional certification, development bootcamps, coursework completed, and completed university degrees.

## P - Practice

Practice is the time and effort spent building projects using code, whether in the workplace, at school, or as a hobbyist.


## O - Organizational

This is a measure of experience the candidate has in a technical workplace environment. 

This is not necessarily workplace experience as a developer. This could be a non-technical person, such as a manual QA specialist or a business analyst, working closely with an engineering team.

## C - Community

This indicates familiarity with and participation in the developer community.
